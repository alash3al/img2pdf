# img2pdf
Convert a directory of images to one PDF file. 

This is a very rudimentary program. Images that are not A4 size will be squeezed to fit A4, which may not look pretty. 

# installation
* You must have `Golang` compiler
* open your `terminal` and run `go get -u github.com/alash3al/img2pdf`
* have fun `img2pdf -src /path/to/images-dir -as ./images.pdf`
